# HARA V13 Engineering Instructions

## Production entry points

```powershell
python -m hara_agent doctor --template TEMPLATE.xlsx
python -m hara_agent confirm-template-role --template TEMPLATE.xlsx --select "ROLE=SHEET!A1:B9" --confirmed-by REVIEWER
python -m hara_agent analyze --item ITEM.docx --template TEMPLATE.xlsx --output REPORT.xlsx --operating-mode MODE --allow-draft
```

The installed console entry is `hara-agent`. There is one runtime; do not recreate old controllers, fallback engines, Domain profiles, compatibility adapters, or alternate report generators.

## Truth-source contract

- Template → `TemplateRoleContract` → `MethodContract`.
- Item/source documents → typed `ProjectFacts` and neutral `RiskFacts`.
- `MethodContract + ProjectFacts/RiskFacts` → HARA evaluation.
- `HARAState + ReportContract` → template-preserving Excel report.
- Human confirmation is required only for unresolved semantic ambiguity or engineering approval.

Template role confirmations and explicit `MethodRiskFactBinding` records are bound to `template_hash`; repeat runs with the same template reuse them. They are generated governance artifacts, not a third manually maintained business input.

## Non-negotiable rules

- Never copy S/E/C, ASIL, scenario, SG, or Safe-State business rules into Python.
- Never identify a method role by a fixed sheet name, sheet order, row, column, range, or workbook hash.
- Never infer missing project facts from template examples or defaults.
- LLM outputs must be schema-bounded, source-linked, and `PENDING` until approved when they contain semantic inference.
- Examples and references are non-executable unless the template explicitly marks them normative.
- Ambiguous rules, range gaps/overlaps, missing facts, hash mismatch, or conflicting facts fail closed.
- ASIL is determined only through the active `MethodContract.asil` matrix.
- Renderer coordinates come only from the compiled `ReportContract`; copy the template package, write atomically, reopen, and verify.
- Static HARA columns may be hierarchically merged only by canonical field identity. Dynamic S/E/C, ASIL, SG, and remark fields are never merged.

## Architecture boundaries

- `src/hara_agent/template/`: workbook scan, role discovery, role confirmation, rule parsing, MethodContract compilation. No project/domain runtime imports.
- `src/hara_agent/services/extraction/`: source-grounded project fact extraction and normalization.
- `src/hara_agent/services/semantic/`: bounded semantic agents; no engineering-rule authority.
- `src/hara_agent/services/analysis/`: generic MethodContract executors and fact binding.
- `src/hara_agent/services/reporting/`: ReportContract-driven rendering only.
- `src/hara_agent/workflow/`: typed state, checkpointing, quality gate, orchestration.

## Required validation

Before handoff run:

```powershell
python -m pytest -q
python -m compileall -q src scripts
git diff --check
```

Also run `python -m hara_agent doctor` against the active template. Any skipped or unavailable live-provider test must be reported separately; offline compiler and unit tests must never require a Provider.

## Documentation authority

`SKILL.md`, stage skills, this file, the active input documents/template, compiled contracts, and deterministic services are current authority. Historical migration documents must not be restored as runtime guidance.
